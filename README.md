# C++


### C++  -  Documentation

> :warning: This repository's task to document whole syntax of C++.

> :memo: Folder structure is easy. You write example code to example.cpp then practice in practice.cpp, also you will document some notes at the end like summary, what you have learnt and practiced, where you can use that or not.
